## Contribution

Hey Vampire Survivor dev! How about adding profiles to the game? It'd be perfect for showing my friends the thrill of starting fresh, you know, experiencing the game as if everything is new again. (Not having all stuff already unlocked.) I bet it could really hook new players into buying the game to. Check out the repo if you're curious, you can use everything. Let's make this awesome game even better together!
